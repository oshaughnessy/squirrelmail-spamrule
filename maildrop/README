This directory includes a sample global maildrop config file and
individual filter files that can be included from a user's
.mailfilter.  The global file needs to be somewhere like
/usr/local/etc/maildroprc, and the individual files need to be
in their own directory, somewhere like /usr/local/etc/maildroprcs.
Your own maildrop installation may expect somewhere else, like /etc.
